### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- For those coming here to *use* Panda3D/CPython on android and browser, you need to clone PyDK and trigger the Github action CI
to get the artifacts for all android architectures ( 1.3GiB download ).

Once done with that you can seek for help on #Panda3D freenode irc (quick answer) or discord ( ymmv ).

Note : all pip modules compiled via pydk are ABI compatible with P4A from kivy.

- For others well everything here is very experimental, async, unthreaded and Python centric.
