### Hi there !

NOTE : pydk for python+webassembly is getting obsoleted by pygbag which will allow soon to load pygame/Harfang3D/Panda3d/raylib CPython wheels directly from http servers.

- For those coming here to *use* Panda3D/CPython on android and browser, you need to clone PyDK and trigger the Github action CI
to get the artifacts for all android architectures ( ~400 MiB download ).

Once done with that you can seek for help on #Panda3D discord.

Note : *all* pip modules compiled via pydk are ABI compatible with P4A from Kivy / Beeware packaging because it's CPython out of the box too.
 ** But you'll have to figure out how to load them by yourself and how to deal with API levels baseline differences. **

PyDK is for everyone and that means starting at API19 for me, keep and use your old tablets for education !

- For others well everything here is very experimental, async, unthreaded and Python centric.


- Looking for collaboration on C-Python Â® for WebAssembly, or alternatives
